# odin-recipes
This is a basic recipe website to practice my current knowledge of HTML! This project will demonstrate my HTML skills such as using HTML elements & tags, creating HTML boilerplates, and working with text, lists, links, & images. Additionally, this project will demonstrate skills in Git basics and writing commit messages.
Hello Odin!
